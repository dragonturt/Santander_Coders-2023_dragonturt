# Memorial

Before being my cousin, you were my friend. Becoming family was just much of a coincidence. 

I have never forgotten the day we met, and I never will.

I was always cheering for you and wanted all your dreams to come true.

I'm thankful for your forgiveness and for being your friend. You had such a kind heart.

**Eu sinto demais a sua falta, meu amigo.**

See you, Space Cowboy.
